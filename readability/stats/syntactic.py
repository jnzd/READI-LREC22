The syntactic module contains functions allowing to calculate notions related to grammatical complexity.

A parse tree can be used to obtain features such as average tree height, average number of noun/verb-phrases per sentence,
Longest/Average distance between sets, length of synctactic units (sentence/clause/paragraph) or a 
T-unit level, which is 1 main + subordinate(s) clause : amount of coordinated/sub clauses, nb of clauses per t-unit, etc...
