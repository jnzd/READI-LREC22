# 2. Avg OLD20(Orthographic Levenshtein Distance) / PLD20(Phonological Levenshtein distance) per word 
# = Average distance of 20 closest words found in lexicon, or closest phonemes.
# Can be found on the 125,623 entries of the Lexique 3.6 database.
# 3. Avg number of commonly known senses per word aka polysemy

# There apparently exists a list of 23,342 annotated French words, done by francois et al 2016
# Pedagogical features :
# variables designed from official Reference Level Descriptors for French (Beacco et al 2008)
# Ch 4 and 6, 5,518 entries from 8,486 (dropped duplicate)
# Features : prop of words associated to A1,A2,B1,B2 and what's not covered aka difficult
# Features based on Distributed Representations
# aka use the embeddings from deep learning.
# extract per sentence, then mean across for a passage.


# Dubois-Buyse information:
# File column names are : Mot / Echelon / Commentaire / Variantes / age / A.Scolaire / cycle
# Mot contains the word itself
# Echelon "ranks" the word between value 1 to 43 (higher value = knowledge of word acquired later in life)
# Commentaire and Variantes are not useful, they indicate whether a word is composite, and the lemmatized form but this applies for only a few words out of several thousands
# age and A.scol indicate the age, and corresponding grade where a word is ranked. 
# cycle indicates the placement of a word within the five three-year cycles, although the fifth one only contains the first year.
