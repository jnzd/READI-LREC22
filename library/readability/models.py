#Pseudo-docstring:
# The models module acts as an high-level interface for the use of language models.

# TEMP : It should be able to provide the following :
# 1) Instantiate/load a model (most likely from Huggingface)
# 2) Customize the model
# 3) Train the model (and optionally save it)
# 4) Use the model for different tasks
